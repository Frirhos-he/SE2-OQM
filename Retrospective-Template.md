# TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 05)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

<!-- - Number of stories committed vs. done
- Total points committed vs. done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) -->
  | Description | Committed | Done |
  | ----- | ------- | ------ |
  | Number of stories |4 | 3|
  | Total points | 6| 4|
  | Nr of hours | 48.45 | 38.25|

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

<!-- > Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) -->

<!--
Mainly the definition of DONE referred to passing the implemented unit tests as well as.
On "Call the next user" and "See the next number" we instead focused on code review by 2 members of the team per story -->

### Detailed statistics

| Story                  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| #0                     | 11      |        | 30         | 22           |
| Get the ticket         | 2       | 2      | 7          | 4.45         |
| Call the next user     | 2       | 2      | 7          | 3            |
| Know the people before | 3       | 1      | 7          | 5.50         |
| See the next number    | 3       | 1      | 1.75       | 1            |

<!-- > place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case) -->

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  | Description | Estimated | Actual |
  | ----- | ------- | ------ |
  | Hours per task average |2.5 |1.72 |
  |Standard Deviation (h) | 9.93| 7.56 |

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 = 0.47
>We hope we can be better next time.

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 4h
  - Total hours spent 1.58h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 0
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated ?\*
  - Total hours spent *NA*
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated ?\*
  - Total hours spent ?\*

\*We didn't make a time estimation about the code review/E2E testing thus we didn't take in consideration it.

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
> Unexperience mainly
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
>We need to better organize ourselves, both in terms of use of the tools and how to split the work.  
>An example is that we didn't manage the time for merge branches, and this lead to miss a story to be completed on time.
>Anyway, we can't complain on how six persons that didn't know each other before worked.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
> This is our first retrospective.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
> This is our first retrospective.
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
> Our goal is to be better organized as a team, complete the tasks committed on time and pay more attention on the use of the tools (youTrack and github).

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!  
***All of us did his/her best, and this is a good point of start!***
